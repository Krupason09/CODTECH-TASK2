# BMI Tracker App

## Project Overview

### Project Title
**BMI Tracker App**

### Objective
To develop a user-friendly application that calculates and tracks Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height. The app helps individuals monitor their health status and provides classification categories (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obesity) to promote awareness of healthy weight ranges.

### Key Activities
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Defined user requirements and functional specifications for the BMI Tracker App.
2. **Application Development**:
   - Implemented the BMI calculation logic using Python.
   - Designed an interactive console-based interface for user input and output.
3. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Conducted rigorous testing to ensure accurate BMI calculations and appropriate categorization.
   - Addressed edge cases such as invalid or out-of-range inputs.
4. **Documentation and Delivery**:
   - Documented the app's functionality and usage instructions for end-users.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**:
  - Core Python libraries for calculations and input/output handling.
